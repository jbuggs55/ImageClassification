    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "## Evaluating Model Performance\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",
    "* Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives."

    "#### Naive Bayes\n",
    "   * One real-world application - Medical Imaging to determine if cancer cells exist on an X-Ray \n",
    "   * Strengths - fast(less training time and less training data required), generally performs well with multiple classes and insensitive to data imbalances\n",
    "   * Weakness - Relies on events being independent. Must pick which features which matter to you. Hard to debug as probabilities get multiplied MANY times so you need to ensure its doing whats intended. May not scale well with larger datasets\n",
    "   * Why Good candidate? Data seems to be highly dependent. Also, not multiple classes involved. Naive Bayes is not a good candidate\n",

    "#### Decision Trees - Use this\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * one real-world application - Accepting college applications algorithm\n",
    "   * Strengths - Flexible, easy to understand. Useful in determining statistical relationships to assist in building additional classifiers\n",
    "   * Weakness - Can overfit easily depending on hyperparameters, may not generalize the best, doesn't take advantage of combining models as variants of decisions trees do(ensemble methods). Quick up front but may spend more time pruning the tree\n",
    "   * Why Good candidate? Data is lightweight and worth identifying performance. May not need clusters of data to determine prediction. \n",
    "   * references - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10317885/decision-tree-vs-naive-bayes-classifier\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Ensemble - Bagging Classifier - Use this\n",
    "   * one real-world application - facial recognition\n",
    "   * strengths - aims to reduce variance, not bias. Base classifiers are more diverse given the random subsets. Helps with model performance\n",
    "   * Weakness - not as smart as boosting, training time may take longer due to multiple subsets. No learning rate so it may overshoot convergence\n",
    "   * Why Good candidate? - Given data set is mixed with 8 catgorical and 5 numerical columns, relatively small, no missing data and few outliers, a Bagging Classifier is a good candidate \n",
    "   * references - https://www.techopedia.com/why-does-bagging-in-machine-learning-decrease-variance/7/33193\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Ensemble - AdaBoost Classifier - Use this\n",
    "   * one real-world application - computer vision object recognition\n",
    "   * strengths - In comparison to SVM's, achieves high level of classification performance with much less hyperparameters. Flexible classifer which can be used for basic and complex classificaion problems. May be less susceptible to overfiting in comparison to other learning models\n",
    "   * Weakness - Can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers\n",
    "   * Why Good candidate?  - Given data set is mixed with 8 catgorical and 5 numerical columns, relatively small, no missing data and few outliers. Additionally, this is a binary classification problem. We these data set attributes, the AdaBoost Classifier is a good candidate\n",

    "   \n",
    "#### SVM - \n",
    "   * one real-world application - computer vision object recognition\n",
    "   * strengths - Regularisation parameters forces user to consider overfitting/underfitting. Kernel trick allows user to separate data using higher dimensional planes. Defined using a convex optimisation problem(no local minima) \n",
    "   * Weakness - Not an elegant solution for multi-class problems. Kernel models are sensitive to overfitting. Takes a while to train.\n",
    "   * Why Good candidate?  - Data set is relatively basic and thus the complex data transformations may not be required. If data set was larger with possibly more variables, then we may need to use an SVM\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",

    "Based on my evaluation, I would recommend employing an AdaBoost Classifier Model. The adaBoost model, when 100% of training data is used, has a similiar F-score on training and test, indicating the model generalizes well to new data. Additionally, the model has a fractionally better F-score than other models on the test set. Training/prediction time is within reasonable limits. Other models such as Bagging and SVM's take longer to train and have lower F-scores in comparison to the AdaBoost Classifier. Overall the Adaboost had a higher accuracy and F-score in relation to other models tested. Finally, since the data isn't noisy and doens't have noticeable outliers, Adaboost classifier suits the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "CharityML wants to avoid the error classifying individuals who make more than 50K as individuals who make less than 50K. Doing so means the charity will not target individuals. In contrast, if CharityML mistakenly classifies someone who makes less than 50K as a potential target, this is generally ok. While you still want to minimize these mistakes to avoid misuse of resources, the model should lean towards higher recall. With an F-Score at .73, the model inidcates a higher recall. "

    "The education number of years aligns with my expectation. I didn't have hours per week in my top five but after thinking about it, the more you work, possibly the more money you make, especially at the 50K threshold. I wasn't sure what capital loss or capital gain values represented. If they represent losing or making money on their investments, I'd assume the more investment gains/losses incurred represent having more disposable income. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
